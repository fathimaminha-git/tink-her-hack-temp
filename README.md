“The flowchart illustrates the workflow of TrashTalk AI, starting from image upload, followed by AI-based waste detection and classification. Based on the identified waste type and recyclability, the system generates environmental impact details, a roast message, and updates the user’s eco progress.”

## 📌 Project Description

TrashTalk AI is an AI-powered web application that analyzes waste images and identifies the type of trash using a vision model. It provides recycling guidance, environmental impact insights, and a humorous “roast” to promote responsible waste disposal. The platform makes sustainability awareness interactive, educational, and engaging.

---

## ❗ Problem Statement

Improper waste segregation and disposal contribute heavily to environmental pollution. Many individuals lack awareness about whether an item is recyclable or how it impacts the environment, leading to increased landfill waste and ecological damage.

---

## ✅ The Solution

TrashTalk AI uses an AI vision model to classify waste from images and instantly provide:
- Waste category detection  
- Recycling status  
- Environmental impact information  
- Disposal guidance  
- A humorous roast to encourage better habits  

By combining AI with awareness and engagement, the system promotes smarter waste management.
